Conway's Game of Life
=====================

An AssemblyScript example.

Instructions
------------

To build `assembly/game-of-life.ts` to `game-of-life.wasm`, run:

```
$> npm run build
```

Afterwards, open `game-of-life.html` in a browser (ideally one that allows `fetch`ing the `.wasm` from the local filesystem).
